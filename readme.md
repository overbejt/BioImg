This is currently just a sanity check to show that using 
python with OpenCv is working.  If it does not, then something 
is wrong with the configuration of the system.

This program uses python 3.  It also uses OpenCv.  To make sure that 
you have OpenCv with the python bindings, just open a terminal and 
run :

    
$ pip3 install opencv-python
    

Then you should be all set.  Just run the program by entering:

    
$ python3 CvFaceRecTest.py
